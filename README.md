# deep-learning-challenge

## Project Description
 - This assignment uses Google Colaboratory to create a deep learning model. The purpose of this analysis is to help the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup create a tool that can help them select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.
## Summary of Contents
### Preprocess the Data
 - Create a dataframe containing the charity_data.csv data, and identify the target and feature variables in the dataset
 - Drop the EIN and NAME columns
 - Determine the number of unique values in each column
 - For columns with more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value
 - Create a new value called Other that contains rare categorical variables
 - Create a feature array, X, and a target array, y by using the preprocessed data
 - Split the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets
 - Scale the data by using a StandardScaler that has been fitted to the training data
### Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model  
 - Create a neural network model with a defined number of input features and nodes for each layer
 - Create hidden layers and an output layer with appropriate activation functions
 - Check the structure of the model
 - Compile and train the model
 - Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the loss and accuracy
 - Export results to an HDF5 file named AlphabetSoupCharity.h5
### Optimize the Model
 - Repeat the preprocessing steps in a new Google Colaboratory
 - Create a new neural network model, implementing at least 3 model optimization methods
 - Save and export your results to an HDF5 file named AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5
### Write a Report on the Neural Network Model
 - A written analysis
 - Summerization of analysis
 - Give examples of how to optimize a model in the future
## Getting Started
 - This assignment uses Google Colaboratory with the obtained data and creates the required deep learning model.
